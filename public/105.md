The SMSC Simulator product include 3 parts.

The SMPP Decoder is a professional tool that you can use it to display
SMPP 3.4 messages for detailed analysis.

The SMSC Simulator is a service for near-to-live testing of your SMPP
applications without need of access to real SMSC. The application behaves
as a real SMSC with SMPP interface, your application can bind to it,
submit_sm, deliver_sm, unbind etc., however nothing will get delivered
anywhere as all the responses are only made-up by the Simulator. It also
supports multiple connection but the authentication information is ignored.

The Mobile Server is a simulator, since the SMSC Simulator can't send real
short message to Mobile user, so it will forward short message between SMSC
and mobile phone simulator(full version include).
